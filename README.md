# My Projects (from Newest to Oldest)

## Project: Voice Command Recognition
[Link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-voice-command-recognition.git)
This was a team project created for the Golem AI society. Our goal was to implement two types of convolutional neural networks and an additional model to perform sound classification. I was responsible for implementing a 2D CNN and managed to achieve 87% accuracy.

### Technologies
- PyTorch
- Python

## Project: Heat Equation
[Link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-heat-equation.git)
### About
This project is a simulation of heat transfer on flat surfaces. It was created as a team project for FO (General Science) classes. The heat equation is a differential equation, so we had to use numerical methods to solve it. We opted for FTCS and BTCS, where FTCS turned out to be faster and more effective for our application.

### Technologies
- Python

## Project: Flashcards
[Link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-flashcards.git)
### About
A team project created for PAP (Application Programming) classes. It's a flashcard application with a spaced repetition system, folder sharing, and other features. From a technical point of view, it's a three-layer, containerized web application.

### Technologies:
- **Backend**
  - Java with Spring Boot
- **Frontend**
  - React (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
- **Database**
  - MySQL
- **Containerization**
  - Docker

## Project: Task Manager
[Link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-task-manager.git)
### About
This solo project was created to practice Java and explore RAD (Rapid Application Development) with JavaFX. My main goal was to apply knowledge learned in a Spring Boot course in a real-world project. This application allows users to create tasks, schedule them, and categorize them into folders.

### Technologies
- Java with Spring Boot
- JavaFX
- MySQL

## Project: Smart Bin
[Link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-smart-bin.git)
### About
This was a team project where we had to create a smart bin with an ESP-32 microcontroller. This bin was connected to the internet, so users could view its status and other information on a website. This repository contains our code for the database, website, and microcontroller.

I was responsible for programming the microcontroller. The main problem I encountered was unpredictable results from sensorsâ€”for instance, we used a distance sensor to detect lid opening, but we had to filter its signal due to many imperfections.

### Technologies
- MicroPython
- Vue.js
- MySQL

## Project: Restaurant POS
[Link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-restaurant-pos.git)
### About
This is a team project where we created a POS (Point of Sales) system for restaurants. It allows restaurant owners to easily configure table positions, menus, and other settings via CSV files (in the `memoryHandlerConf` folder). It provides basic functionality for creating orders and switching current waiters. A waiter can only see orders assigned to them.

### Technologies
- nCurses
- CMake
- C++

## Project: Battleships
[Link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-battleships.git)
### About
A simple game of Battleships. It has two modes: player vs. player or player vs. computer.

### Technologies
- Python
- Pygame
- NumPy

## Assembler Projects
The projects listed below find markers on a given bitmap. A marker is defined as an "L" shape, with the ratio between the longer and shorter lines equal to 2. Size did not matter.
